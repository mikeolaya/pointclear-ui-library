            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Edward is the Director of Digital Health for a large health system operating
across three large regions of two states. He oversees multiple innovative
solutions such as mobile and devices that improve consumer outcomes and
efficiencies. He is also responsible for expanding and implementing all
things telehealth. The health system is fully EMR integrated; all workflows
are organized within the EMR. This is the #1 thing he keeps in the back of
his mind when integrating with technology solutions.</p>

            <p>Edward finds telehealth compelling because it improves access to care,
especially in rural areas, and lowers costs. A telehealth offering is a
differentiator that makes their health system attractive to employers, which
drives up membership. Increasing membership brings in more business.
Telehealth is key to their population health strategy. Since they are
reimbursed on a wellness basis, keeping patients healthy and out of the
hospital by use of telehealth visits will drive their overall costs down.</p>

          <p>There are many use cases for using telehealth. It will allow for the
expansion of primary care, offering virtual options for follow-up visits.
Recently discharged patients, especially those that cannot travel to a
transitional medical clinic, can have telehealth visits with physicians or
pharmacists to make sure they are following discharge instructions and
properly taking their medication. Telehealth can also help with chronic
care management, allowing patients to meet with mid-levels or their care
team. He also wants to use telehealth for a nurse advice line and to meet
with physicians for acute conditions. It is important to inform a patient’s
PCP about these visits so they can follow-up if necessary. Telehealth can be
used to improve physician-to-physician consults and multi-doctor
encounters. Tele-ICU is also desired.</p>
