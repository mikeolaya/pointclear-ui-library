            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Dr. Norton has been a general practitioner, with a speciality in emergency
            medicine, for the past 24 years. The majority of his career has been in the
            ER, although he got worn down by the schedule and moved to an urgent
            care center a few years ago. He is a huge champion for patient safety and
            quality, and treating the patient so they are in and out as fast as possible.</p>

            <p>A colleague of his recommended telehealth. Excited about what
technology could do to solve some of the process problems existing in
healthcare now, Dr. Norton explored the option of telehealth further. He
has now been a telehealth provider for the past 2 years. Initially he had
around 150 consultations a month, but is currently well into 400 - 600
consults. Now, Dr. Norton works mainly as a telehealth provider and
works a few days a week at the urgent care center. He likes the flexibility
telehealth provides, but still has some issues with the system.</p>

          <p>Dr. Norton has a very active life and often takes consultations on the go.
However, the platform does not allow him to see his availability on his
existing calendar because the two calendars don’t synch. He holds most of
his sessions via telephone because video takes more time to set up and the
software is often an issue. Many video sessions are dropped and he spends
too much time trying to reconnect with patients, impacting patient care
and possibly causing him to miss out on potential revenue from other
patients in need of assistance. He thinks telephone sessions are very
effective and allows him to deliver the same level of care as video, so he is
not compelled to make himself available for video sessions.</p>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Dr. Kloss is a pediatrician in Chicago, Illinois and has been
practicing medicine for over 30 years. Currently, she works at a
practice that she has been a part of for the last 10 years of her
career. Dr. Kloss began working in telehealth two and a half years
ago after being referred by another doctor. Now, Dr. Kloss sees
telehealth patients in between her scheduled in-person patient
visits. Eventually, she wants to retire from her brick and mortar
practice, but keep telehealth as a way to continue practicing
medicine as she transitions into retirement.</p>

            <p>To maximize her reach and help build her patient base, Dr. Kloss
works on three different telehealth systems, each with their own
pros and cons. She finds that a majority of her issues have to do
with her patients’ lack of tech savviness or reliable internet
connections, especially with regard to video, uploading photos,
and re-requesting her as a provider.</p>

          <p>Aside from technical issues, Dr. Kloss has discovered that though
she is a pediatric doctor, she has been lumped in with all of the
other general practitioners on most of her telehealth platforms.
This forces her to decline multiple adult patients daily. She feels
that the platform should direct only pediatric patients to her and
make it easier for parents to find her when their children are ill.</p>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Emilia is a licensed clinical social worker and has been practicing
for 12 years. Working mainly in a private practice, Emilia had a
great set of clients in her hometown of Sacramento, California.
However, she recently found herself as a new resident to the Los
Angeles area. Prior to her move, she was worried about losing her
clients because of the distance. It was around this time that she
was introduced to telehealth by an insurance company.</p>

            <p>When Emilia moved she became a telehealth provider to allow
her clients to continue seeing her. This allowed her patients to
maintain their comfort level and stay with someone that knows
them well, instead of starting over again with a new therapist. She
was very happy to keep her client relationships and now spends a
fair amount of time each week in telehealth sessions with new
and existing clients.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Emilia has noticed that there are not as many
insurance companies listed on her current telehealth platform
and feels that this is hindering the growth of her patient list.
Having had a bit of trouble with marketing her practice in her
new city, she is hoping that the inclusion of more insurance
companies would make the burden of being both therapist and
marketing team much easier.</p>
