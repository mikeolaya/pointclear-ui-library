            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Ms. Guerrero works as a 3rd grade teacher in upstate New York. She
spends her day keeping up with her class, then rushes home to take care
of her family. She does not have time to go to the doctor when she feels
under the weather. Unfortunately, she is having issues with what she
thinks is a UTI. However, Ms. Guerrero is at work on a short lunch break
and unable to leave to go to urgent care. It would be very inconvenient if
she had to go to the urgent care after work and wait to be seen, even if it
only took an hour. Who will pick up the kids? How will dinner get on the
table? She and her family are heading out of town the next afternoon.
and she can’t wait to take care of the issue later.</p>

            <p>A coworker suggested talking to a doctor using telehealth. She was a little
nervous, but felt with her tight schedule, this option would work best.
The elementary school has horrible data service and blocks many
websites, so she decides to call the service and set up an appointment
that way.</p>

          <p>Once she gets in touch with the operator and sets up an account, the
operator helps her set up an appointment and connect with the first
available provider. A provider calls her back within 2 minutes. The
doctor was very friendly, helpful and was able to call in a prescription to
her pharmacy that is on the way home. She found the entire experience
convenient and will definitely use telehealth again. She really liked the
doctor she spoke with and would like to see the same doctor in the future.</p>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Hayden is a 29 year old stay-at-home mom with a new baby of 3 months.
After giving birth Hayden wasn’t like herself, fighting unusual thoughts
and feeling like she was always walking through a fog. After doing some
research online she thought it was time that she speak with a therapist.
With such a young child and feeling some anxiety about leaving home,
Hayden opted for telehealth for her therapy session. This medium would
allow her to stay with her child and speak freely in the comfort of her
home.</p>

            <p>Hayden signed up for an account, with a bit of difficulty finding her
therapist and finding a time for the appointment. She was only able to
suggest times that worked for her instead of seeing what options her
therapist of choice had available.</p>

          <p>After a couple visits with her online therapist, Hayden was diagnosed with
postpartum depression. At this point her therapist suggested that she
speak with a psychiatrist, who would give her the option of medication to
help her issue. Hayden wants to continue speaking with her therapist and
wonders why the psychiatrist can’t join their recurring appointment to
help and prescribe the medications. She doesn’t want to go through her
whole story with another person or pay double for multiple appointments
with two separate providers.</p>

<p>She really appreciates and feel that she needs the care she is being given
by her provider, but wishes the collaboration between providers was a
smoother process for her.</p>
